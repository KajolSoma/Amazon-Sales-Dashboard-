I'm excited to share my Excel project : an Amazon Annual Sales Report for 2022!

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the successful completion of my Amazon Annual Sales Dashboard using Excel.

Objective: Using my data analytics skills, I gathered Amazon sales data for 2022 from the Amazon website and transformed it into an Excel dashboard. This dashboard provides valuable insights into the 2022 sales and offers recommendations for improving sales in 2023.

Key Topics Covered:

Data Cleaning: I addressed issues such as blank rows across all columns and duplicate values in the 'Courier,' 'City,' and 'State' columns. Additionally, I standardized the 'Order Date' column data types.

Category-wise Total Sales: The dashboard includes category-wise sales data, helping the business identify high-performing categories that should be prioritized for stock in 2023.

Sales by Category Size: I analyzed sales by category size, enabling the business to understand which sizes performed best and should be stocked more in 2023.

Top 5 States by Sales: This analysis highlights the states with the highest sales in 2022, providing insights for targeted marketing and strategic planning to drive business growth in 2023.

Order Status Analysis: By examining order statuses, I identified trends in returns, pending orders, and shipped orders. This helps the business understand and address issues causing returns and delays.

Monthly Sales Trends for 2022: The analysis shows that April and May had the highest sales, while sales from July to January were lower. This information can guide promotional strategies and discount offers during lower sales months.

Daily Order Trends: I included a visualization showcasing daily order volumes. This helps the business identify patterns and make data-driven decisions regarding inventory management.
